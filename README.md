# Validation of a Spanish-language Version of a Computer Programming Aptitude Test for First-year University Students

## Summary

The datasets and material to replicate the data analysis of this work are available in this repository. The repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks ready to be run to replicate the results obtained by processing the anonymized datasets collected during 2020 at Federico Santa Mar√≠a Technical University.
It is recommended to use Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com/) to run the Jupyter Notebooks in this supplementary material, as they were created using that tool. Note that each of the Jupyter Notebooks folders in the repository contains a readme indicating which file(s) the corresponding Jupyter Notebook uses.
